MandrillForm
==================

MandrillForm for Craft is very similar to Pixel & Tonic's ContactForm plugin, but uses Mandrill for sending emails instead of your native mail server (if you have one).

How to install and use:

1. Place the mandrillform folder in your craft/plugins folder.
2. Go to Settings > Plugins from your Craft control panel and enable the MandrillForm plugin.
3. Click on "MandrillForm" to go to the plugin's settings page.
4. Enter the email address you would like the contact requests to be sent to.
5. Enter the Mandrill API key.
6. Enter the subject to appear in the emails you receive.

This plugin currently includes v1.0.46 of the Official Mandrill API Client for PHP.  The latest wrapper can be found on [this packagist repo](https://packagist.org/packages/mandrill/mandrill).
